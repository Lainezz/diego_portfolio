            I’m a back-end developer who loves clean, maintainable code and solid design patterns. I enjoy building apps that are structured, reusable, and easy to read. In my free time, you’ll find me cycling, playing tennis, hiking, or grabbing a beer (shhh 😄). Check out my GitHub—my projects might not be flashy, but they’re made with care and a back-end mindset.
